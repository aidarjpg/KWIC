
Key Word in Context (KWIC) problem is a special kind of index for a document.  KWIC is often used as an example problem in software engineering.  Parnas treats this problem at length in the article https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=361623).  

A KWIC index, also called a concordance, is an index to a document where the entries, listed alphabetically, also include some of the context (i.e. the words surrounding the entry).  This repository contains an example KWIC index for a short text document implemented as linked HTML files.  The example consists of three files.
